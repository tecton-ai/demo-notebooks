For the online path, we've configured Tecton to accept real-time events via an HTTP ingestion API which we will try sending records to in the next step. For the offline path, we've pointed Tecton to an S3 path that contains a historical record of our stream. Tecton uses this path for offline development and backfills.\n",

In a Stream Feature View, we can run Python transformations on incoming records, and optionally apply time-windowed [aggregations](https://docs.tecton.ai/docs/defining-features/feature-views/aggregation-engine) via the `aggregations` parameter. These transformations run identically online and offline which is critical for preventing skew.\n",
